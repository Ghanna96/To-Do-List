[To-do List](https://ghanna96.github.io/To-Do-List/)

To Do List written by me using vanilla JavaScript and CSS, no framework was involved during the development except date-fns to format Dates.

How to Use:

-On the left side you find your lists, click on one to reveal its todos.

-On the right side you manage your todos, click to see or edit the details.
